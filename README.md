Goal
The goal of this project is to analyze factors such as income, population density, and distance to travel to competitions has on the growth and success of robotics teams in a district.
Classes
Teams 
Creates a team object and functions associated with that
Main
Creates year and districts, as well as calls graphing sections
Graph 
Graphs either year, district, all districts in a year, or all years based on parameters. 
The graph will choose x-axis options (  income, distance from competition, travel cost, population density, etc.)and y-axis(district points, district rank, income, distance from competition, travel cost) options
Travel Cost(not in progress yet)
Functions to calculate the travel cost of teams based on their distance to competitions, and calculate their distance to competitions. Will then be passed into an attribute of teams
Definitions
Team: 
a type of object that represents a team in a given year. Attributes are from The Blue Alliance API and us zip code API. 
Team name
Team number
Team zipcode
Rookie year
Team rank
zip pop density
Zip med income
District points
(travel cost)
(Miles to competition)
Team key 
Year
A list of team objects forgiven year in a district
District
A list of the years for the years that have existed
